The audio at `br-external/board/raspberrypi2-heating-control/rootfs-overlay/usr/lib/asterisk/sounds` files were generated with the voice Hans from Amazon Polly. (The pricing of Amazon Polly was pretty reasonable).

The file `audio.txt` contains all used phrases. The audio files were converted from `mp3` to `sln` with `conversion.sh`.
